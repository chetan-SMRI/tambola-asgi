# tambola-asgi



Tambola software made in django, can play upto 1000 users at a time. Builds perfectly without any issues.

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Uses Asyncronous communication protocol instead of wsgi to make it fast and broadcast based.


<b>Evit Stull Warning:</b> Also, a very good and bad thing about it is, it can be set to win any particular ticket for any award like housefull,luckydraw and all. Has a 80-90% chance of winning the ticket you set to win. I am not maintaining this project, but using continuous bruteforceing method, this can be easily manipulated to 100% winning chance now.
